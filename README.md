# AlphaFold 3 Minimal Implementation  
  
This repository contains a minimal implementation of AlphaFold 3, a state-of-the-art protein structure prediction model. The implementation is forked from the repository X (provide the link to the original repository), and it has been simplified for educational purposes or quick prototyping.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
Before running this implementation, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:  
  
- Python (version >= 3.9)  
- Pytorch 2.4  
  
## Quick Start  
  
To get started with this minimal implementation of AlphaFold 3, follow these steps:  
  
1. Clone this repository:  
- git clone https://github.com/Babak70/Minimal-Alphafold

2. Run the model with your prepared inputs:  
  
3. Prepare your input data. You will need to construct the following:  
- `atom_inputs`: A tensor that represents the features of individual atoms.  
- `atom_input_pairs`: A tensor that represents the features of atom pairs.  
- `atom_mask`: A mask tensor to indicate the presence of atoms.  
- `atom_positions`: A tensor that contains the positions of atoms.
